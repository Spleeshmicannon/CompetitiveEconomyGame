# CompetitiveEconomyGame
A game where you compete with virutal economies against each other written in Java

### Version 0.2 changes
This version still doesn't have multiplayer but has some added mechanics. There are now social classes related to the resources and Health that will cause the player to lose if it gets low enough. Health cannot be healed. The social classes are more just cool to look at but provide little change to how the game is played.
